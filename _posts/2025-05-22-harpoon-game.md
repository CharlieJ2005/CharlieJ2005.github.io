Heya, I've decided to share a project I've been toying with for the past few months. It's still in development, and far from what I want the finished product to look like, but I thought it'd be fun to share my process so far. So, welcome to the first devlog of "Untitled Harpoon Game" (name pending).

The core idea behind this project is a simple roguelike experience that's fairly small in scope. I thought it'd be important to ground myself for a project like this, and to avoid feature creep I've identified all the features I want to implement before really digging into them. I have a ton of ideas, and to avoid spoiling my future devlogs, I'll just keep them to myself for now. But how about I show you what I _have_ done?

The first step in any Unity project was creating simple movement, which really took no time at all. I then went straight to work on the harpoon -- the main draw to my game. I thought it was incredibly important to have a mechanic that felt good to the player. It was essential to really nail the basics before going ahead with any other aspects of design, so I spent a lot of time fine tuning.

After quickly putting together a crosshair aiming system, I created a method in the `CharacterController` class called `PullPlayer()` which does exactly what the name implies. Whenever the player "shoots" a harpoon that successfully collides with an enemy, the `HarpoonScript` calls the Player's `PullPlayer()` method, which then pulls the player to the enemy's location and released when they're within a close enough range, eliminating the enemy in the process.

Creating fluid in player movement is very important to me, so I wanted the harpoon to pull the player slowly at first, but accelerating as they build up more momentum. To do this, I modeled the harpoon's pull speed $p$ with the following formula:

$$p = 1.3^{x + 10}, 0 < x < 5$$

Where, for every frame of being pulled, the speed variable $x$ is increased by 0.5 until it plateaus at $x=5$, resulting in a max pull speed of $\approx 51.186$ $\text{tiles/frame}$. This resulted in the exact feel I was going for, and led to a really dynamic feeling movement mechanic. Though, there was still something missing...

It's here that I took a little break from working on the harpoon mechanic to figure out other game elements. I kept the artstyle of the game really basic, to the point where there was no need for any placeholder sprites, as anything I'd whip up in the moment was good enough to use in the final build. This way, I was able to create shells of new mechanics I'd come back to build on later.

The first of which being the basic enemy, which at the moment follow the player in a straight line and lack any intelligent pathfinding (something that would look quite silly once I had the tilemap properly implemented). I was originally just going to download a library, but I think it'd be more fun to tackle the pathfinding myself further down the line, so these dumb little robots will have to do for now.

Next, I worked on the basis for the upgrade system. I wasn't quite sure of _every_ upgrade I'd be working on, so I created a basic harpoon level up. It'll increase your harpoon's level when collected, which at the moment is purely cosmetic, simply changing the color of your harpoon from white to blue. I also implemented a currency system wherein eliminating enemies gives you coins, though the functionality is not yet implemented into the game.

Finally, before getting back to fine-tuning the movement, I created an alternate weapon for the player. While the harpoon is a fun mechanic, giving the player more choice never hurts. For that reason, I implemented an alternate weapon that can be used when right-clicking. While quite effective against enemies, it runs out of ammo fast and has horrible spray. Often your bullet will be aimed up to 15Â° off-target, though I thought this was a good tradeoff for the high fire-rate and knockback inflicted on targets. The gun refills its ammo on enemy elimination, incentivizing regular use of the harpoon gun as the core gameplay mechanic.

Now it was time to finish what I'd started and implement the last part of the harpoon mechanic, preserved momentum. In order to make the player truly feel like they're hitting their targets, I implemented a system that 'snaps' them to the center of the enemy once they're close enough. While this is great from a gameplay perspective, it completely killed all player momentum and led to pretty anticlimactic moments after an enemy was defeated. 

So, I wrote code to store the player's transform and velocity and apply it to them after they've snapped to the enemy, only that doesn't feel satisfying either as they come to a dead stop as soon as they try to walk. So, what I settled on was a "skating" mechanic of sorts, where the player will glide at an increased speed after using their harpoon. This comes with reduced control, but if you land enough successive hooks that won't be a problem. To really sell the effect, I created a trail on the player (which required horrible amounts of debugging to work by the way) and made it so that colliding with enemies in this state will deal damage relative to the player's speed.

Smoothing out the edge cases for this one really sucked, especially those pertaining to transitioning in and out of the "skating" state. Though in the end I'd say it's incredibly worth it and changes the entire game. Now, building up clusters of enemies is incentivized, as with one good hook you can go back and knock them all out. This was a much needed change and one that fundamentally changes the way the player interacts with the game for the better. Now movement is fluid and is really satisfying to mess around with; I think we have the basis of a fun game.

To add more impact, I decided to use Unity's particle system to implement explosions when enemies are defeated, as well as a slight darkening of their color as their health decreases. This adds a lot more satisfaction upon enemy eliminations and their change in appearance helps you keep track of which enemies are one collision away from defeat.

I messed around with Unity's TextMeshPro package, though ultimately settled on not using it. I think it'd be interesting to see what design choices can be made to communicate the core gameplay principles without the use of any text, so for now, I'll avoid it. I'm not sure I'll stick to that, but it's something I'm trying out for the moment.

Lastly, I took the one room I'd designed and stored it as a prefab, allowing me to load it wherever I want. I then created the `RoomGenerator` class which I'll be using in the future to procedurally generate dungeons in a roguelike fashion. For now though, the functionality is really limited and it just spawns the basic prefab room 15 times in a row lol.

Anyways, that's all for this first devlog on the project. I've mainly been taking this first stretch to familiarise myself more with Unity and lay some groundwork for what's to come. I'm aiming to complete the procedural generation algorithm for next time, and possibly implement some of those upgrades I've been talking about.
