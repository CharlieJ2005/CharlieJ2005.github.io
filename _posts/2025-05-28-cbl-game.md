I worked on this project as part of the CBL (challenge-based learning) component in my programming course at TU/e. The goal was to create a videogame completely within Java Swing without the use of external libraries.

Since this was a group project, I paired up with [Astrid Bergstr√∂m](https://www.linkedin.com/in/astrid-bergstrom-9a971b23b/) to bring our game to life. Over the course of 27 days, we worked to create a platforming / puzzle game that involves navigating a maze while avoiding your pursuers.

This was by far one of the most challenging programming projects I've undertaken to date, as we had to implement our own custom rendering logic for the scene, along with programming the maze generation algorithm from scratch. While it was tough, I'm happy to report that we came out the other end with a finished product and a somewhat competent game (a feat which is particularly impressive if you're familiar with Java Swing).

We completed this project in October of last year, but recently I cleaned up some of the audio bugs and re-routed the image pathing to polish the game a little so I can provide a download link. Please note that there are still issues with clipping through walls, but that's just what happens when you try coding your own collision logic from scratch.

It was fun revisiting this project over 6 months after it started, and I hope you'll enjoy checking it out yourself.
